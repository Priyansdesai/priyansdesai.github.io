    Hi everyone! I am Priyans Nishithkumar Desai, a rising junior at the University of California, Berkeley. I am studying Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I am passionate about software engineering and algorithms. Recently, having worked at Scanta Inc, I got a lot more interested at the intersection of Machine Learning and Computer Security. I am not just extremely keen to explore these fields as individual entities, but also deep dive into what their intersection has to offer.
